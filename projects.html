                <p>
                    We created a QR code on this website that leads to a form for citizens who visit the police station for whatever reason. Citizens can provide comments about the police station on that form, and if they have any complaints, they can go straight to the top officials. Additionally, just the complaint is kept in the database and no other person is given access to the citizen's personal information.

                <p>
                    We create a website where anyone can adopt any animal from us. We are working to assist as many people as we can through the usage of this website. Because we allow users to adopt pets for a limited time, our website differs slightly from other pet adoption services. I'm the front-end developer for this website, and I created the entire thing.
